Today you'll go through a website cloning challenge. This is not part of any gate or assessment. It's just there for you to check where your gaps in CSS are. So don't start learning last-minute-CSS now. Stick to your time boxes.

Note that the cloning will be done with HTML and CSS only. You won't use React. You can use any CSS framework you want to, but you also don't have to use a CSS framework. (Later in the program you'll be focusing on Tailwind CSS, but for today you don't need to use it.) You can use JavaScript if you need to, but it's not necessary. This exercise is about CSS not about JS DOM.

One more thing, once you have created the repository, add your coaches to it as collaborators. And also paste a link to the repository and to the deployed link in your group's channel, so your coaches can verify successful deployment. If you have any trouble in the deployment process, approach your coaches for help.
